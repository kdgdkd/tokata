# tokata turntable simulator

tokata allows to play songs out of a small collection of vinyl singles. It is all an html simulation, of course. But it makes static noise when putting on the needle, the arm moves with the song and turns around the center when it is over. It is all pretty basic, but so am I. 
I would like to improve the look on mobile phones, but proper CSS is a bit elusive for me.   

This was created as a kind of homage to my dear uncle, who gave me his vinyl collection several decades ago. Eskerrik asko!
