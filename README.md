# tokata turntable simulator

tokata allows to play songs out of a small collection of vinyl singles. It is all an html simulation, of course. But it makes static noise when putting on the needle, the arm moves with the song and turns around the center when it is over. It is all pretty basic, but so am I. 

The code is nothing to write home about, but feel free to use it if you like it. You just need to replace the files in the tracks folder with your own.

I looks good on a computer with horizontal screen, but I would like to improve the look on mobile phones, which is not very consistent, I fear.   

This was created as an homage to my dear uncle, who gave me his vinyl collection several decades ago. Eskerrik asko!
